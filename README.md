# **Node JS Express for FrontEnd Developers a Practical Guide: Overview and Motivation**

In [ReactJS for Angular Developers a Practical Guide: Overview and Motivation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reactjs-angular-developers-practical-guide-overview-motivation-gold-vybqf/?trackingId=FkPkAKqXQCyXJjE6%2Fuh40g%3D%3D), I explained how after a long period working with Angular, I felt I should reacquaint myself with [React](https://react.dev/). I started by looking at my React project repos on [Github](https://github.com/trider). This proved to be a frustrating experience because, after seven years of working exclusively in one framework, it was nearly impossible to understand what I had written in the other. I had no choice but to relearn everything from scratch. Eventually, I was able to build a [sample task management](https://github.com/trider/react-task-manager). After achieving my initial goals, I felt sufficiently competent in React to move on to other things. When I next revisited the project, I had a general idea of what everything did but understanding what I had created required more effort than I expected. 

To avoid repeating the same mistake, I decided to create a practical guide to learning React based on the code I had written. I took the project and broke it down into smaller mini-projects. Each mini-project would illustrate specific React features with each new project building on the knowledge acquired in the previous step. The result was [ReactJS for Angular Developers](https://github.com/trider/react-task-tutorial). 

For each article in the series, I wrote sample Angular code to illustrate how to perform this functionality in Angular. As a long-time Angular developer, this forced me to reexamine some of my assumptions regarding Frontend development. An additional benefit of writing Angular examples was that it allowed me to learn the latest version of [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview). It also inspired me to write another series, [Angular for React Developers](http://ng-task-tutorial) where I took a similar approach but from the opposite direction.

Now I covered the basics of building web applications with React and Angular, I thought that I should move from the frontend to the backend. At this point, both series interact with and display data from static files and my intention for both series was to teach how to work with REST APIs. In addition, I recently learned how to build a REST API using [Node.JS](http://Node.JS), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/). In order to avoid my original mistake of learning something, and having to learn it again, Iâ€™m launching a new mini-series, on creating a NodeJS backend. As with my previous series, I will be looking at Node from the perspective of a frontend developer. Once I complete this series, I will be publishing new installments of my Angular and React series.

The tutorial includes the following installments:
